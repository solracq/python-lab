Flash back to Austin, Minnesota, in 1937.
These good folks are about to hit upon an amazing little recipe:
a spicy ha packed in a handy dandy 12-ounce can for Years.
SPAM soars. In fact, in that very first year of pro
           duction, it grabs 18 percent of the market.
Over 65 years years later, more than 6 billion cans of SPAM have
been sold.
