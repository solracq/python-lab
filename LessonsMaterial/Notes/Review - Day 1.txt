Bad Jokes

Python
  - Strongly but Dynamically Typed
  - Reserved Words
  - indentation 
    - determines code blocks, like if and while.
    - most popular way is with 4 spaces.
    - second most popular way is with tabs.
    - never mix tabs and spaces

while True:
    print("There are four spaces indenting this line")
    break

ageString=input("Your Age:")
age=int(ageString)
if age<40:
    print("Under 40")
elif age<65:
    print("Over 40 under 65")
else:
    print("Over 65)

print("Doug", "abc", "Mike", sep=", ",
    end="\n", file=sys.stderr)

strings
    s="this is unicode \N{DEGREE SIGN}"
    s=u"The u in front is not required in python 3."
    s=r"This is a raw string that allows \ slashes"

format (see appendix)
    s="Hello {0}".format("Doug")
    s="Hello {0:>10s}".format("Doug")
    s="Hello {0:+5d}".format("5")
    s="Hello {0:<+1.2f}".format("5.5")

sys.argv
    sys.argv[0] - Name of the python script we ran.
    sys.argv[1] - First command-line argument.

Built-In functions
  len(sys.argv)

Truthiness
    Falsey things include
       0
       0.0
       None
       Empty Sequences (Empty Strings, Empty Lists, Empty Sets)
       False
    Everything else is Truthy

    while 5:  #5 is truthy
    while 0:  #0 is falsely

and/or/not
    if (5 and 0)

    s = input("Enter your name (default=Anonymous):";
    s = s or "Anonymous";

    short circuit evaluation
    if (doA() and doB())


Ternary Operator
    s = input("Enter your name (default=Anonymous):";
    s = s if len(s)>0 else "Anonymous"

    # IN C++: len(s)>0 ? s : "Anonymous"

    #Equivalent to:
    if (len(s)>0):
      s = s
    else:
      s = "Anonymous"

    #Equivalent to:
    s = input("Enter your name (default=Anonymous):";
    if (not s):
        s = "Anonymous"



Questions:
    What is "pass" for? It is a 'null' block to indicate that nothing happens
    What is if __name__="main":? Code will be executed within the 'if' block only when code runs directly
