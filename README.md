Python Lab
===========
This repository contains structured Python exercises and experiments focused on strengthening core engineering skills relevant to automation, testing, and systems development.

The goal of this repository is not tutorial-based learning, but deliberate practice of:
- Python language fundamentals and idiomatic usage
- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Writing clean, maintainable, and testable code
- Exploring patterns applicable to automation and tooling development

Exercises are organized incrementally and may evolve over time as concepts are refined or expanded.

This repository serves as a personal engineering lab and reference for continuous improvement.
